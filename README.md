ALICE MMPSearch

This is a repository with the purpose of creating a site using Jekyll to serve as a LMMS Beat File Library.

The intuitive is to be able to collect information from the files by indexing it and allows search with the most diverse filters.

It is part of the master's research in Computer Science at the Federal University of São João del Rei, focused on independent underground music production and the use of open source technologies.

The mainstream only exists because the underground created the scene.
